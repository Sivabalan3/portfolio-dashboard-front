        <p>Here, IP stands for internet protocol. It is a protocol defined in the TCP/IP model used for sending the packets from source to destination. The main task of IP is to deliver the packets from source to the destination based on the IP addresses available in the packet headers. IP defines the packet structure that hides the data which is to be delivered as well as the addressing method that labels the datagram with a source and destination information.

          An IP protocol provides the connectionless service, which is accompanied by two transport protocols, i.e., TCP/IP and UDP/IP, so internet protocol is also known as TCP/IP or UDP/IP.

          The first version of IP (Internet Protocol) was IPv4. After IPv4, IPv6 came into the market, which has been increasingly used on the public internet since 2006.
